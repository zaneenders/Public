        "Welcome to my guide to what I like to call the worlds hardest video game. Or what most of the world calls programming. The tech giants have been hiding a lot of cools hacks so buckle up its gonna be a fun adventure."
        "Step 0: Learn Swift"
        "Ok im a 100% joking and not even gonna explain that. At the current time of writing this that is not a good idea."
        "Weird fact that will make more sense. Computers start counting at zero and will soon be probably your first bug. Which is often referred to an off by one bug"
        "Step 1: Get an idea of something you wanna build."
        "I would write this down. Start a note book, google doc your favorite task manage what ever. Just write down something you wanna try and build. Doesn't matter what it is."
        "That having some end goal will help drive you when you get stuck. It will happen I promise. There is a 1,000 little things your gonna end up learning by accident or intently."
        "Step 2: Build a web scrapper"
        "This is my personal opinion but you will feel like a wizard being able to pull data off the web like all the Large Language models in the world do. But this one your in control of."
        "There are some rules/ regulations on this so don't scrap IMBD. The goal of this is to get something working not make an app with someone else hard work and get sued. Google `robots.txt` if you wanna learn more about scrapping rules."
        "Step 2a: Downloading and setting up software."
        "Just like any new adventure in the digital world you are gonna start with downloading some software."
        "What you need is a something called a text editor. Pretty high tech I know. No you can't use word or google docs. Trust me thats just gonna make things harder."
        "So go and download VS Code and were gonna run some scary commands and setup something called version control."
        "Don't worry you don't need to know what any of this means or is just follow the instructions. It will make sense later. I think its better to just follow me blind on this then explain."
