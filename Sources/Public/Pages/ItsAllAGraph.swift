        everything naturally ends up as some sort of graph. More commonly Trees (Dretic asynlic graphs). Your file system. Your social or knowledge graph. If you look at the world as a lens form you. You are the root node and everything graphs out from there. Thats not how the world actually works but interms of organizing and understanding the world and making connections and getting context it all roots at you and how things interconnet is up to you. Filesystem are also graphs. Which are a great idea but more often then not we wanna connect things in more complicated ways then a file tree and sim linking isn't the best most scalable interface to do it.
