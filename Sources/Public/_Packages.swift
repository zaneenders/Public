As the new year approaches I wanted to shift how I work on projects both my own and others. In the past do to anexity and imposters Syndrome I have kept to my self and scared to share things until they were ready. Which when I started things made sense share things when they are ready to be seen. But what I have learned that doesn't mean you have to hide in the basement getting stuck over and over grinding away trying to get every detail right. My new thought is to work more in public inviting others ideas and thoughts on my approach and persepective on this crazy world we call software.

To kick off this new mindset and approach I have been breaking up a private repo that is roughly 30,000 lines of text files comprised of programming languages like swift or just plane text files used for notes in markdown. So far I have made a few packages public. I refer to them as Pacakges as they are all Swift Packages. I tthink I will save the why for the Swift part of my website and will update this page to link over to it. But in short I really like how composeable Swift packages are and the fact that the packages them selves are swift code along with the Swift's compilers ability to do pre build file geneartion I think it setups up nice to package up little amounts of work that are easy to share and contribute too.

I have published a few packages so far.
- ScribeSystem
- MySetup
- Scribe
- _WebsiteBuilder
- HerbieFP

I plan to publish many more as I think software should be composed and worked on in this package like format. Where the package it's self can do checks for enviorment setup and dependecie management. Well other languges i'm sure can do this I know Swift best despite it's lack in popularity it's what i'm using. I also like the idea of using it as a subsituie for a scripting langague like bash. Well bash is great for quick things and this is no excuse to learn or use it. I think using a modern porgramming languge has it's benfits like a Type system and when things get more complicated you don't have to go oh maybe I should rewrite all these scripts. You are already in a language and can just expand as the project does. I am taking this idea from Kelsey Hightower who talks about the idea of documenation and automation which I have been trying to apply as I have been learning about the vast complexity that is software. In an effort to not repeat my self too much.

Well these packages my not be useful to many right now. I hope that as I iterator on them and my own enviorment this will grow into the Operating System/ Personal Development Enviorment and honestly want I want to call Personal Operating System.
