        "Was looking at the problem of well we have math that can generate infinite predictable strings. Well why can't we find math equations that produce strings of numbers for the data we are trying to store. I think this still might be possible but very hard to align everything just right. In a sense you would have to perfectly align the output of a function with the output of some something else and even then You can't search for sub strings because I was shown as an example the string 100 is more then a 100 digits into pi."
        "In short this was my bad idea to try and store information in PI."
